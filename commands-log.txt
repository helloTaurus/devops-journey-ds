This is where I will store my learning progress from deepseek.

# See where I am in the filesystem
pwd

# List the files and directories in my current location
ls

# Created a new directory called 'devops-journey'
mkdir devops-journey

# Change current directory to the new one
cd devops-journey

# Created my first file
touch hello-world.txt

# Check the contents of the file (it will be empty)
cat hello-world.txt

# Used 'nano', a simple text editor to inser some text into the file.
nano hello-world.txt

#learned some git commands
#see status of git
git status

git add

git commit
